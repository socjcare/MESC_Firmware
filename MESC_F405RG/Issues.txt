- Torque mode- works in sensorless and absolute encoder mode
speed - does ot work with the RuModifiedSpeedControl in both Sensorless and
Absolute Encoder Mode.


There seems to be a problem when the startup mode has sensormode Absolute Encoder selected.
 Torque mode does ot work. When chaged to Sensorless, Torque Mode works in both
 sensorless and AbsoluteEncoder Mode.
 
 Now, when switched to speed mode, no longer noisy.
 
 FOC.PLL_Kp  and  FOC.PLL_Ki are used somewhere else so create a differet PLL value
 for the encoder.
 
 
 Now , torque and speed mode works in sensorless and absolute_encoder mode
